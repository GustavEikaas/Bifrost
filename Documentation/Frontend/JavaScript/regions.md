# Regions

Regions are at the center of the visual composition of the application.
A region is a logical grouping of a [view](views.md) and a [view model](view_models.md).
All regions are implicitly created during compositions, Bifrost manages creation and
lifecycle of them.

## Hierarchy

A region can have child regions. The region will be aware of any of the child
regions properties and respond to their changes recursively. This allows for checking
things like validation without having knowledge about the concrete different regions.
[Commands](commands.md)

## Inheritance

Regions are hierarchical by nature since a view can basically choose to include one or
more other views. Each of these views being referred to gets a region associated with it.
A view model is optional, but will by convention automatically be loaded and instantiated
and associated into the region.

Each region has a relationship to the parent region, not only through the parent property,
but also through inheritance. Regions inherit the parent region, making it possible to
access properties one wants to share at a higher level.

## Region Descriptors

Expanding a region with properties or functionality is done through what is known as a
region descriptor. This makes it possible to separate out this into its own concept.

```javascript
Bifrost.namespace("BoundedContext.Feature", {
    RegionDescriptor: Bifrost.views.RegionDescriptor.extend(function() {
        this.describe = function(region) {
            region.aCommonProperty = "Something";
        }
    })
});
```

## Properties

| Property                  | Type     | Observable | Description |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| view                      | View     | X          | Holds the actual view for the region |
| children                  | Region[] | X          | Array of child regions |
|Â parent                    | Region   | X          | Parent region |
| isValid                   | Boolean  | X          | Returns validation related to any commands in the hierarchy |
| validationMessages        | String[] | X          | Array of any validation messages|
| canCommandsExwecute       | Boolean  | X          | Returns wether or not all the commands are capable of executing |
| areCommandsAuthorized     | Boolean  | X          | |
| commandsHaveChanges       | Boolean  | X          | |
| areCommandsReadyToExecute | Boolean  | X          | |
| hasChanges                | Boolean  | X          | |
| isExecuting               | Boolean  | X          | |
| isComposing               | Boolean  | X          | |
| isLoading                 | Boolean  | X          | |
| isBusy                    | Boolean  | X          | |
