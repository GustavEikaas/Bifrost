# Overview

Bifrost targets the line of business type of application development. This space has very often requirements that
are somewhat different than making other types of applications. Unlike creating a web page with content, line of business
applications has more advanced business logic and rules associated with it. In addition, most line of business applications
tend to live for a long time once they are being used by users. Rewrites are often seldom in this space, as it involves a lot of
work to capture existing features in a new way. This often means that one needs to think more about the maintainability
of the product. In addition to this, in a fast moving world, code needs to built in a way that allows for rapidly
adapting to new requirements. It truly can be a life/death situation for a company if the company is not able to adapt
to market changes, competitors or users wanting new features. Traditional techniques for building software has issues
related to this - by design. N-tier architecture tends to mix concerns and responsibilities and thus leading to
software that is hard to maintain. According [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks) and
["The Mythical Man-Month"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), 90% of the cost
related to a typical system arise in the maintenance phase. This means that we should aim towards building our systems
in a way that makes the maintenance phase as easy as possible.

The goal of Bifrost is to help make this better. By focusing on well established software patterns and practices,
and sticking to them without compromise, we believe this is possible. Bifrost embraces a set of practices described 
in this article and tries to adhere to them fully.
